# Neural Network Library (nnlib)

This is Luke Godfrey's neural network library (nnlib). It is an all-header library to facilitate the use of artificial neural networks.
To get started, clone the repository, cd into src, and make install. Then, in a new C++ file, you can `#include <nnlib.h>` and start coding!
See src/main.cpp for an example of how to use nnlib.
